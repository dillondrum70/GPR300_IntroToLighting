I chose the GL Falloff method for lighting attenuation because of the control the combination of linear and exponential falloff provides.  While I was tempted to use the UE Windowed method which is tried and tested, it requires more work to be done with exponentials and could therefore be more computationally expensive.  While it could be a slight problem that GL Falloff requires that 3 components be exposed, it is offset by the control gained.
